# tapioca

To use this very simple script that creates a very simply poem written by a very wonderful person, follow these instructions.

Change directories after cloning the distro by typing in:
`cd ./tapioca`

Now you'll need to make the shell script executable, to do this type in:
`chmod +x ./poem.sh`

Now that it is executable, execute the .sh file:
`./poem.sh`

Please read it a few times, its important to me.
